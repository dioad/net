gograph: AST-aware Repository Navigation Tool for AI Agents

Use gograph whenever you need to find a symbol or analyse call trees in a Go
(*.go) codebase. Before answering architecture, dependency, or "where is X?"
questions about this repository, read `.gograph/GRAPH_REPORT.md` first — use
it as the repo map before searching raw files. Use `gograph query` and
`gograph callers` for symbol lookup.

━━━ READ FIRST ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
This repository contains an llm-wiki/ directory with curated context pages.
Read them BEFORE writing any code or running any analysis:

  llm-wiki/README.md        → index of all wiki pages
  llm-wiki/project.md       → project identity, non-goals, correctness model
  llm-wiki/rules.md         → binding rules (git, build, testing, architecture)
  llm-wiki/agent-contract.md → session lifecycle and tool selection contract

If generated pages are missing: gograph build . --precise && gograph wiki

━━━ PREREQUISITE ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
ALL query commands read from .gograph/graph.json. If it does not exist, every
query fails. Build it once before anything else:

  gograph build .            fast, tolerates broken code — use during development
  gograph build . --precise  type-checked CHA — use before refactors (needs compilable code)

After build: graph.json + Markdown reports are written to .gograph/.
The .gograph/ ignore entry is appended to the Git repository root .gitignore
when available; outside Git, the build target .gitignore is used.
If no Go files are found after ignore filtering, build exits before writing artifacts.
  gograph stats   → counts (packages/files/symbols/calls/routes/SQL/tests)
  gograph stale   → lists source files newer than graph.json (shows newest source time/file)

Rebuild whenever source files change. The graph does NOT auto-update.

━━━ COMMON WORKFLOWS ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  Start of any session         → summary  (top hotspots + worst instability + highest complexity + orphan/god-obj counts in ONE call)
  Onboard to unfamiliar repo   → hotspot, skeleton, focus <pkg>
  Find where X is defined      → query <term>  then  source <sym> to read body
  Understand a symbol (raw)    → context <sym>  (callers+callees+source+tests in one call)
  Understand all changed syms  → context --uncommitted  (all contexts bundled — use after plan --uncommitted)
  Understand a symbol (deep)   → explain <sym>  (role, complexity, SQL, env, routes, interfaces)
  Before editing any symbol    → plan <sym>     (callers, tests, SQL/env/route risk)
  After editing, before commit → review --uncommitted  then  build . --precise
  Before a package refactor    → dependents <pkg>  (every consumer of this package)
  Full blast radius of change  → impact <sym>  or  impact --uncommitted  or  impact --since <ref>
  PR / branch scope review     → changes --git main
  HTTP endpoint deep-dive      → endpoint <handler>  (route + call chain + SQL + env)
  Error root-cause trace       → errorflow <err_str>
  Dead code sweep              → orphans
  Test coverage gaps (codebase) → untested  (callers but zero test edges — one sweep, sorted by risk)
  External symbol signature    → doc <pkg.Symbol>  (stdlib/third-party — no graph required)
  API breaking-change check    → api --since <ref>
  CI enforcement               → gate, check --since <ref>

━━━ WHEN TO USE WHAT ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
FINDING THINGS — three different scopes:
  query <term>      broad: searches symbol names, file paths, package names, import paths, call sites
  node <sym>        exact: AST metadata for one named symbol (kind, file, line, signature, doc)
  source <sym>      body: extracts the actual source code block — use instead of reading the file

CALL GRAPH — two different depths:
  callers/callees <sym> [--depth N]   bounded: 1 hop (default) up to 10 — use for focused exploration
  impact <sym>                         unbounded: full BFS to ALL transitive callers — can be large on hotspots
  <sym> can be a short name ("Validate" — fuzzy substring match), a standard Go package-qualified
    name ("graph.Graph" or "graph.Graph.Build" — standard dot-notation), or a fully-qualified
    ID ("pkg/path::(*Service).Validate" — exact match, no same-name conflation). Use
    the dot or FQ form to disambiguate overloads/duplicates. Requires --precise build for
    full effect. Works for callers, callees, impact, and path (both endpoints).

SYMBOL UNDERSTANDING — two different outputs:
  context <sym>   structured data: node + source + callers + callees + tests — fast, token-efficient
  explain <sym>   narrative: role classification, prod vs test split, complexity, SQL, env, routes, interfaces
                  → use context when you need lists to act on; use explain when you need to understand purpose

PACKAGE RELATIONS — three different questions:
  deps <pkg>           what does this package import? (outgoing)
  dependents <pkg>     what imports this package? (incoming) — essential before refactoring a package
  imports <path>       which files import this specific import path? — for tracing one external dependency

STRUCT / TYPE — five different angles:
  fields <struct>        what fields does this struct have?
  embeds <struct>        which structs embed this struct?
  constructors <struct>  which functions return this struct? (New*, factory functions)
  literals <struct>      where is this struct initialized as Foo{...}? (run before adding a required field)
  implementers <iface>   which structs satisfy this interface?
  interfaces <struct>    which interfaces does this struct satisfy? (inverse of implementers)
  usages <type>          where is this type used? (param/return types, struct fields, iface methods)
                         → use before changing any interface or type — shows the full blast radius

PACKAGE vs SYMBOL scope:
  focus <pkg>    everything in a package: files, all symbols, internal calls, imports
  public <pkg>   exported symbols only: the package's API surface
  context <sym>  one symbol only: deep slice of a single function/struct/interface

ERRORS — two different questions:
  errors              where are all errors defined and returned in the codebase?
  errorflow <term>    how does this specific error reach the HTTP layer? (definition → return sites → entry point)

━━━ OUTPUT FORMAT ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
All search/navigation commands support four output modes:

  (default)       [kind] Name — detail  (file:line)  — one result per line
  --json          {"ok":true,"cmd":"...","query":"...","count":N,"data":[...]}
  --files-only    flat deduplicated list of file paths — use for checklists
  --mermaid       visual dependency/call diagrams in Mermaid format
                  (supported by deps, dependents, coupling, callers, callees, path, impact, endpoint)

Use --json when piping output to another tool or when you need structured data.
Use --files-only when you only need to know which files are involved.

━━━ STATIC ANALYSIS LIMITATIONS ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Know these before trusting results:

  Interface dispatch    callers/callees may miss calls through interface variables unless
                        'build . --precise' was used (enables type-checked CHA call graph)
  errorflow             heuristic AST traversal — NOT SSA/data-flow. Useful for navigation,
                        not proof. Confidence rating (HIGH/MEDIUM) is a heuristic estimate.
  endpoint              route patterns only resolve flat string literals. Gin/Echo/Chi
                        Group() prefixes are lost at AST level — always search by handler
                        symbol name, not route string.
  impact / skeleton     can produce very large output on hotspot symbols or large repos.
                        Use callers --depth N for bounded traversal instead of impact.
  All results           reflect the state of graph.json at last build. Run 'gograph stale'
                        to confirm the index is current before structural analysis.
  Subdirectory safe     all query commands auto-discover the project root (walks up to
                        the nearest .gograph/ directory). No need to cd back to the repo
                        root before running plan, review, or any other query.

━━━ COMMANDS ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
AGENT WORKFLOW RULES (CRITICAL):
1. BEFORE editing: run 'gograph plan <symbol>' — callers, tests, SQL/env/route risk in one call
2. AFTER editing:  run 'gograph build . --precise' then 'gograph review --uncommitted'

                       any directories listed in .gitignore (via git check-ignore).
